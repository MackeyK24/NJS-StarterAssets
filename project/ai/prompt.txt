# Web Application

Generate a react web application front end for our **scene driven** Babylon Toolkit game project. Please reference the https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonToolkit repo for details about
web game development using the **Babylon Toolkit**. Content is exported from Unity as interactive GLTF scene files that support **script components**. 


# Script Components

The **Babylon Toolkit** (https://www.babylontoolkit.com/) provides modern game engine mechanics with a familiar Unity like scripting system to fast track native web game
development using BabylonJS. Details can be found at repo https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonToolkit

The toolkit allow you to code faster with intelligent tooling and mechanics using a familiar Unity like scripting model:
```
import { ScriptComponent } from "@babylonjs-toolkit/next";

export class DemoComponent extends ScriptComponent {
  public message: string = "Hello Babylon Toolkit";

  protected start(): void {
    console.log(this.message);
  }

  protected update(): void {
    let deltaTime: number = this.getDeltaTime();
    this.transform.rotate(BABYLON.Axis.Y, deltaTime);
  }
}

```


# Content Creation Tools 

The **Babylon Toolkit Unity Exporter** (https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonToolkit/tree/master/Editors/Unity) is a **Content Creation Tool** used to export interactive
scene files with extra UnityGLTF metadata to instantiate **Babylon Toolkit Script Components** classes that have be encoded as **extras**.


# React Component Framework

The **Babylon Toolkit React Framework** will be installed that actually renders the interactive scene as a route. The framework already includes the
`ApplicationRoute` and `BabylonSceneViewer` react components:
```
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/play" element={
          <ApplicationRoute allowDevMode={true}>
            <BabylonSceneViewer rootPath="/scenes/" sceneFile="mainmenu.gltf" allowQueryParams={true} enableCustomOverlay={false} />
          </ApplicationRoute>} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

React router navigation can be used to load scenes from **anywhere**:
```
navigate("/play", { state: { fromApp: true, rootPath: "/scenes/", sceneFile: "levelone.gltf" } });
```

or load a blank scene at runtime and handle creation in code:
```
navigate("/play", { state: { fromApp: true, sceneFile: "_blank", auxiliaryData: "anything" } });
```


# Important Project Create Notes

You must create a comprehensive web application with **ALL** the required user interfaces using VITE, REACT and TYPESCRIPT.
The app should use the specified **HTML UI Template** or default to Tailwind CSS if not specified.
The app should have a `Main Menu` home page type feel and support for user presence and login.
The app should have some FILLER gaming content like `User Achievements` and `Leaderboards`.
